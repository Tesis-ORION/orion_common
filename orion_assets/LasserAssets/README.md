# Lasser Assets

This directory contains the drawing files for the parts intended to be cut with Laser. They were exported by using **FreeCAD**.

## Preparations

To build your ORION robot, you can cut the pieces over acrilic, MDF or similar materials with a thickness between 3 mm to 6 mm, depending on the material and the endurance you want. You require an area of material between 1 m² to 1.5 m².

The .dxf extension files were provided as they are the most common ones that are asked when going to a workshop to cut pieces. If your require other formats, please refer to **[FreeCAdAssets](/orion_assets/FreeCadAssets/README.md)**, search the pieces you need and convert them to the desired format.

### Required pieces to build ORION 1.3.x to 1.6.x

You will require the next pieces:
