## Content

You can find the next information and files:

- **[3DPrintAssets:](/orion_assets/3DPrintAssets/README.md)** It is a collection of assets in STL so you can pass the files to your slicer and start building the ORION robot.

- **[FreeCadAssets:](/orion_assets/FreeCadAssets/README.md)** They are the source CAD of the project, so if you want to make modifications or take a look of the pieces you can do it freely by using *FreeCad 1.0.0*.

- **[LasserAssets:](/orion_assets/LasserAssets/README.md)** Another option to create some parts of ORION is by using laser cuts on MDF, acrilic or similar materials. This only applies to bases and walls.

- **[calc_inertia.py:](/orion_assets/calc_inertia.py)** It is a file oriented to obtain the inertia of STL and URDFS by providing the object path, the scale and the mass.
