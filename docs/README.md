## Tips and tricks

If you need to compress the files, you can use the [reduce.sh](/docs/reduce.sh) file, which was used to compress the original files in order to upload them to Github.

If you want to easily generate the links to access the images on the Wiki in MD format, you can use [links.sh](/docs/links.sh).

If you want to use HTML instaed, so you can manage the image alignment and size, use [html_format.sh](/docs/html_format.sh).
